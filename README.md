# Live Face Detection with OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using a webcam and the Haar Cascade Classifier provided by OpenCV. It draws rectangles around detected faces in the video feed and allows the user to exit the program by pressing the 'q' key.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using a webcam.
- Highlights detected faces with bounding boxes.
- Easy-to-use and lightweight implementation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenCV library
